Paragraph 1. Marriage is to be between one man and one woman; neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband at the same time.#1 (#1 Genesis 2:24; Malachi 2:15; Matthew 19:5-6 )

Paragraph 2. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife,#2 for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue,#3 and the preventing of uncleanness.#4 (#2 Genesis 2:18;#3 Genesis 1:28;#4 1 Corinthians 7:2, 9 )

Paragraph 3. It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with judgment to give their consent;#5 yet it is the duty of Christians to marry in the Lord;#6 and therefore such as profess the true religion, should not marry with infidels, or idolaters; neither should such as are godly, be unequally yoked, by marrying with such as are wicked in their life, or maintain damnable heresy.#7 (#5 Hebrews 13:4; 1 Timothy 4:3;#6 1 Corinthians 7:39;#7 Nehemiah 13:25-27 )

Paragraph 4. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity, forbidden in the Word;#8 nor can such incestuous marriages ever be made lawful, by any law of man or consent of parties, so as those persons may live together as man and wife.#9 (#8 Leviticus 18;#9 Mark 6:18; 1 Corinthians 5:1 )
