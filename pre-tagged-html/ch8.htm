<P><B>Chapter 8: Of Christ the Mediator</B></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
Paragraph 1. It pleased God, in His eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, his only begotten Son, according to the covenant made between them both, to be the mediator between God and man;<sup>1</sup> the prophet,<sup>2</sup> priest,<sup>3</sup> and king;<sup>4</sup> head and saviour of the church,<sup>5</sup> the heir of all things,<sup>6</sup> and judge of the world;<sup>7</sup> unto whom He did from all eternity give a people to be his seed and to be by Him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.<sup>8</sup> </br></br><sup>1</sup> Isaiah 42:1; 1 Peter 1:19-20;</br><sup>2</sup> Acts 3:22;</br><sup>3</sup> Hebrews 5:5-6;</br><sup>4</sup> Psalm 2:6; Luke 1:33;</br><sup>5</sup> Ephesians 1:22-23;</br><sup>6</sup> Hebrews 1:2;</br><sup>7</sup> Acts 17:31;</br><sup>8</sup> Isaiah 53:10; John 17:6; Romans 8:30  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 2. The Son of God, the second person in the Holy Trinity, being very and eternal God, the brightness of the Father's glory, of one substance and equal with Him who made the world, who upholdeth and governeth all things He hath made, did, when the fullness of time was come, take upon Him man's nature, with all the essential properties and common infirmities thereof,<sup>9</sup> yet without sin;<sup>10</sup> being conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Virgin Mary, the Holy Spirit coming down upon her: and the power of the Most High overshadowing her; and so was made of a woman of the tribe of Judah, of the seed of Abraham and David according to the Scriptures;<sup>11</sup> so that two whole, perfect, and distinct natures were inseparably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion; which person is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only mediator between God and man.<sup>12</sup> </br></br><sup>9</sup> John 1:14; Galatians 4:4;</br><sup>10</sup> Romans 8:3; Hebrews 2:14; Hebrews 2: 16-17; Hebrews 4:15;</br><sup>11</sup> Matthew 1:22-23; Luke 1:27, 31, 35;</br><sup>12</sup> Romans 9:5; 1 Timothy 2:5  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 3. The Lord Jesus, in his human nature thus united to the divine, in the person of the Son, was sanctified and anointed with the Holy Spirit above measure,<sup>13</sup> having in Him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge;<sup>14</sup> in whom it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell,<sup>15</sup> to the end that being holy, harmless, undefiled,<sup>16</sup> and full of grace and truth,<sup>17</sup> He might be throughly furnished to execute the office of mediator and surety;<sup>18</sup> which office He took not upon Himself, but was thereunto called by his Father;<sup>19</sup> who also put all power and judgement in his hand, and gave Him commandment to execute the same.<sup>20</sup> </br></br><sup>13</sup> Psalm 45:7; Acts 10:38; John 3:34;</br><sup>14</sup> Colossians 2:3;</br><sup>15</sup> Colossians 1:19;</br><sup>16</sup> Hebrews 7:26;</br><sup>17</sup> John 1:14;</br><sup>18</sup> Hebrews 7:22;</br><sup>19</sup> Hebrews 5:5;</br><sup>20</sup> John 5:22, 27; Matthew 28:18; Acts 2:36  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 4. This office the Lord Jesus did most willingly undertake,<sup>21</sup> which that He might discharge He was made under the law,<sup>22</sup> and did perfectly fulfil it, and underwent the punishment due to us, which we should have borne and suffered,<sup>23</sup> being made sin and a curse for us;<sup>24</sup> enduring most grievous sorrows in his soul, and most painful sufferings in his body;<sup>25</sup> was crucified, and died, and remained in the state of the dead, yet saw no corruption:<sup>26</sup> on the third day He arose from the dead<sup>27</sup> with the same body in which He suffered,<sup>28</sup> with which He also ascended into heaven,<sup>29</sup> and there sitteth at the right hand of his Father making intercession,<sup>30</sup> and shall return to judge men and angels at the end of the world.<sup>31</sup> </br></br><sup>21</sup> Psalm 40:7-8; Hebrews 10:5-10; John 10:18;</br><sup>22</sup> Gal 4:4; Matthew 3:15;</br><sup>23</sup> Galatians 3:13; Isaiah 53:6; 1 Peter 3:18;</br><sup>24</sup> 2 Corinthians 5:21;</br><sup>25</sup> Matthew 26:37-38; Luke 22:44; Matthew 27:46;</br><sup>26</sup> Acts 13:37;</br><sup>27</sup> 1 Corinthians 15:3-4;</br><sup>28</sup> John 20:25, 27;</br><sup>29</sup> Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11;</br><sup>30</sup> Romans 8:34; Hebrews 9:24;</br><sup>31</sup> Acts 10:42; Romans 14:9-10; Acts 1:11; 2 Peter 2:4  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 5. The Lord Jesus, by his perfect obedience and sacrifice of Himself, which He through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, hath fully satisfied the justice of God,<sup>32</sup> procured reconciliation, and purchased an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, for all those whom the Father hath given unto Him.<sup>33</sup> </br></br><sup>32</sup> Hebrews 9:14; Hebrews 10:14; Romans 3:25-26;</br><sup>33</sup> John 17:2; Hebrews 9:15  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 6. Although the price of redemption was not actually paid by Christ till after his incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy, and benefit thereof were communicated to the elect in all ages, successively from the beginning of the world, in and by those promises, types, and sacrifices wherein He was revealed, and signified to be the seed which should bruise the serpent's head;<sup>34</sup> and the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world,<sup>35</sup> being the same yesterday, and to-day and for ever.<sup>36</sup> </br></br><sup>34</sup> 1 Corinthians 4:10; Hebrews 4:2; 1 Peter 1:10-11;</br><sup>35</sup> Revelation 13:8;</br><sup>36</sup> Hebrews 13:8  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 7. Christ, in the work of mediation, acteth according to both natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to itself; yet by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature is sometimes in Scripture, attributed to the person denominated by the other nature.<sup>37</sup> </br> John 3:13; Acts 20:28  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 8. To all those for whom Christ hath obtained eternal redemption, He doth certainly and effectually apply and communicate the same, making intercession for them;<sup>38</sup> uniting them to Himself by his Spirit, revealing unto them, in and by his Word, the mystery of salvation, persuading them to believe and obey,<sup>39</sup> governing their hearts by his Word and Spirit,<sup>40</sup> and overcoming all their enemies by his almighty power and wisdom,<sup>41</sup> in such manner and ways as are most consonant to his wonderful and unsearchable dispensation; and all of free and absolute grace, without any condition foreseen in them to procure it.<sup>42</sup> </br></br><sup>38</sup> John 6:37; John 10:15-16; John 17:9; Romans 5:10;</br><sup>39</sup> John 17:6; Ephesians 1:9; 1 John 5:20;</br><sup>40</sup> Romans 8:9, 14;</br><sup>41</sup> Psalm 110:1; 1 Corinthians 15:25-26;</br><sup>42</sup> John 3:8; Ephesians 1:8  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 9. This office of mediator between God and man is proper only to Christ, who is the prophet, priest, and king of the church of God; and may not be either in whole, or any part thereof, transferred from Him to any other.<sup>43</sup> </br></br><sup>43</sup> 1 Timothy 2:5  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 10. This number and order of offices is necessary; for in respect of our ignorance, we stand in need of his prophetical office;<sup>44</sup> and in respect of our alienation from God, and imperfection of the best of our services, we need his priestly office to reconcile us and present us acceptable unto God;<sup>45</sup> and in respect to our averseness and utter inability to return to God, and for our rescue and security from our spiritual adversaries, we need his kingly office to convince, subdue, draw, uphold, deliver, and preserve us to his heavenly kingdom.<sup>46</sup> </br></br><sup>44</sup> John 1:18;</br><sup>45</sup> Colossians 1:21; Galatians 5:17;</br><sup>46</sup> John 16:8; Psalm 110:3; Luke 1:74-75  </p>
