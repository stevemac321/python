<P><B>Chapter 14: Of Saving Faith</B></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
Paragraph 1. The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts,<sup>1</sup> and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the Word;<sup>2</sup> by which also, and by the administration of baptism and the Lord's supper, prayer, and other means appointed of God, it is increased and strengthened.<sup>3</sup> </br></br><sup>1</sup> 2 Corinthians 4:13; Ephesians 2:8;</br><sup>2</sup> Romans 10:14, 17;</br><sup>3</sup> Luke 17:5; 1 Peter 2:2; Acts 20:32  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 2. By this faith a Christian believeth to be true whatsoever is revealed in the Word for the authority of God Himself,<sup>4</sup> and also apprehendeth an excellency therein above all other writings and all things in the world,<sup>5</sup> as it bears forth the glory of God in His attributes, the excellency of Christ in His nature and offices, and the power and fullness of the Holy Spirit in His workings and operations: and so is enabled to cast his soul upon the truth thus believed;<sup>6</sup> and also acteth differently upon that which each particular passage thereof containeth; yielding obedience to the commands,<sup>7</sup> trembling at the threatenings,<sup>8</sup> and embracing the promises of God for this life and that which is to come;<sup>9</sup> but the principal acts of saving faith have immediate relation to Christ, accepting, receiving, and resting upon Him alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace.<sup>10</sup> </br></br><sup>4</sup> Acts 24:14;</br><sup>5</sup> Psalm 27:7-10; Psalm 119:72;</br><sup>6</sup> 2 Timothy 1:12;</br><sup>7</sup> John 14:14;</br><sup>8</sup> Isaiah 66:2;</br><sup>9</sup> Hebrews 11:13;</br><sup>10</sup> John 1:12; Acts 16:31; Galatians 2:20; Acts 15:11  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 3. This faith, although it be different in degrees, and may be weak or strong,<sup>11</sup> yet it is in the least degree of it different in the kind or nature of it, as is all other saving grace, from the faith and common grace of temporary believers;<sup>12</sup> and therefore, though it may be many times assailed and weakened, yet it gets the victory,<sup>13</sup> growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance through Christ,<sup>14</sup> who is both the author and finisher of our faith.<sup>15</sup> </br></br><sup>11</sup> Hebrews 5:13-14; Matthew 6:30; Romans 4:19-20;</br><sup>12</sup> 2 Peter 1:1;</br><sup>13</sup> Ephesians 6:16; 1 John 5:4-5;</br><sup>14</sup> Hebrews 6:11-12; Colossians 2:2;</br><sup>15</sup> Hebrews 12:2  </p>
