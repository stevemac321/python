<P><B>Chapter 32: Of the Last Judgment</B></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
Paragraph 1. God hath appointed a day wherein He will judge the world in righteousness, by Jesus Christ;<sup>1</sup> to whom all power and judgment is given of the Father; in which day, not only the apostate angels shall be judged,<sup>2</sup> but likewise all persons that have lived upon the earth shall appear before the tribunal of Christ, to give an account of their thoughts, words, and deeds, and to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether good or evil.<sup>3</sup> </br></br><sup>1</sup> Acts 17:31; John 5:22; John 5:27;</br><sup>2</sup> 1 Corinthians 6:3; Jude 1:6;</br><sup>3</sup> 2 Corinthians 5:10; Ecclesiastes 12:14; Matthew 12:36; Romans 14:10, 12; Matthew 25:32-46  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 2. The end of God's appointing this day, is for the manifestation of the glory of His mercy, in the eternal salvation of the elect; and of His justice, in the eternal damnation of the reprobate, who are wicked and disobedient;<sup>4</sup> for then shall the righteous go into everlasting life, and receive that fulness of joy and glory with everlasting rewards, in the presence of the Lord; but the wicked, who know not God, and obey not the Gospel of Jesus Christ, shall be cast aside into everlasting torments,<sup>5</sup> and punished with everlasting destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power.<sup>6</sup> </br></br><sup>4</sup> Romans 9:22-23;</br><sup>5</sup> Matthew 25:21, 34; 2 Timothy 4:8;</br><sup>6</sup> Matthew 25:46; Mark 9:48; 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 3. As Christ would have us to be certainly persuaded that there shall be a Day of Judgment, both to deter all men from sin,<sup>7</sup> and for the greater consolation of the godly in their adversity,<sup>8</sup> so will He have the day unknown to men, that they may shake off all carnal security, and be always watchful, because they know not at what hour the Lord will come,<sup>9</sup> and may ever be prepared to say, Come Lord Jesus; come quickly.<sup>10</sup> Amen. </br></br><sup>7</sup> 2 Corinthians 5:10-11;</br><sup>8</sup> 2 Thessalonians 1:5-7;</br><sup>9</sup> Mark 13:35-37; Luke 12:35-40;</br><sup>10</sup> Revelation 22:20  </p>
