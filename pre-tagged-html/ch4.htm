Paragraph 1. In the beginning it pleased God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,<sup>1</sup> for the manifestation of the glory of his eternal power,<sup>2</sup> wisdom, and goodness, to create or make the world, and all things therein, whether visible or invisible, in the space of six days, and all very good.<sup>3</sup> </br></br><sup>1</sup> John 1:2-3; Hebrews 1:2; Job 26:13;</br><sup>2</sup> Romans 1:20;</br><sup>3</sup> Colossians 1:16; Genesis 1:31  </p>

Paragraph 2. After God had made all other creatures, He created man, male and female,<sup>4</sup> with reasonable and immortal souls,<sup>5</sup> rendering them fit unto that life to God for which they were created; being made after the image of God, in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness;<sup>6</sup> having the law of God written in their hearts,<sup>7</sup> and power to fulfil it, and yet under a possibility of transgressing, being left to the liberty of their own will, which was subject to change.<sup>8</sup> </br></br><sup>4</sup> Genesis 1:27;</br><sup>5</sup> Genesis 2:7;</br><sup>6</sup> Ecclesiastes 7:29; Genesis 1:26;</br><sup>7</sup> Romans 2:14-15;</br><sup>8</sup> Genesis 3:6  </p>
<p>

Paragraph 3. Besides the law written in their hearts, they received a command not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil,<sup>9</sup> which whilst they kept, they were happy in their communion with God, and had dominion over the creatures.<sup>10</sup> </br></br><sup>9</sup> Genesis 2:17;</br><sup>10</sup> Genesis 1:26, 28  </p>
