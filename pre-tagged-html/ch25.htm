<P><B>Chapter 25: Of Marriage</B></P>
<P><BR>
</P>
Paragraph 1. Marriage is to be between one man and one woman; neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband at the same time.<sup>1</sup> </br></br><sup>1</sup> Genesis 2:24; Malachi 2:15; Matthew 19:5-6  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 2. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife,<sup>2</sup> for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue,<sup>3</sup> and the preventing of uncleanness.<sup>4</sup> </br></br><sup>2</sup> Genesis 2:18;</br><sup>3</sup> Genesis 1:28;</br><sup>4</sup> 1 Corinthians 7:2, 9  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 3. It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with judgment to give their consent;<sup>5</sup> yet it is the duty of Christians to marry in the Lord;<sup>6</sup> and therefore such as profess the true religion, should not marry with infidels, or idolaters; neither should such as are godly, be unequally yoked, by marrying with such as are wicked in their life, or maintain damnable heresy.<sup>7</sup> </br></br><sup>5</sup> Hebrews 13:4; 1 Timothy 4:3;</br><sup>6</sup> 1 Corinthians 7:39;</br><sup>7</sup> Nehemiah 13:25-27  </p>
<p>
</p>
Paragraph 4. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity, forbidden in the Word;<sup>8</sup> nor can such incestuous marriages ever be made lawful, by any law of man or consent of parties, so as those persons may live together as man and wife.<sup>9</sup> </br></br><sup>8</sup> Leviticus 18;</br><sup>9</sup> Mark 6:18; 1 Corinthians 5:1  </p>
